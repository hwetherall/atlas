A collection of product-management and engineering workflows, prompts, templates, and notes I use day-to-day. Sharing in case any of it is useful to others.

## What's in here

- **[`[skill]-sprint-plan.md`](./%5Bskill%5D-sprint-plan.md)** — A 7-phase sprint execution method for shipping a batch of tickets through spec validation → parallel review → parallel build → quality gates → release. Designed to run with Claude Code subagents.
- **[`[agent]-system-analyst.md`](./%5Bagent%5D-system-analyst.md)** — A Claude Code subagent definition that translates PM/CTO inputs into a structured plan of epics and stories with explicit dependencies, story sizing, and a clarification protocol.
- **[`[agent]-spaghetti-code.md`](./%5Bagent%5D-spaghetti-code.md)** — A Claude Code subagent that audits code for maintainability: spaghetti patterns, unclear naming, missing docs, oversized files/functions, and high cyclomatic complexity. Returns an A-F score with categorized issues and ticket-ready recommendations.
- **[`[agent]-product-counsel.md`](./%5Bagent%5D-product-counsel.md)** — A Claude Code subagent for first-pass legal/compliance review covering GDPR, CCPA, DMA, DSA, and AI regulations. Maps data touchpoints, triages risks (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH), and surfaces issues that need real human counsel.

_File-prefix convention: `[skill]` = a Claude Code slash command (drop into `.claude/commands/`); `[agent]` = a Claude Code subagent (drop into `.claude/agents/`)._

_(More to come — this list will grow over time.)_
